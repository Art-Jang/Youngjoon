<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="http://mm.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Joon Son Chung</a>, in <a href="https://fv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Division of Future Vehicle</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>. 
Previously, I earned my M.S. in <a href="https://fv.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Division of Future Vehicle</a> from <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a> (Feb. 2022) and B.S. in <a href="https://cni.kw.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Division of Robotics</a> from <a href="https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/index.jsp" target="_blank">Kwangwoon University</a> (Feb. 2020). </p>

<p>My research focuses on data-hungry problems (e.g., semi-supervised learning) and bias in data labels (e.g., class-imbalance) for deep neural networks. 
I also have a broad interest in learning general representations (e.g., self-supervised learning) and improving model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., domain generalization).</p>

<p>
  My research aims to effectively train deep neural networks under limited labels and data, such as long-tailed/biased labels and unlabeled data. Also, I have a broad interest in techniques for learning general representations and improving modelâ€™s robustness to distribution shifts, such as uni-/multi-modal representation learning, domain generalization, etc.
